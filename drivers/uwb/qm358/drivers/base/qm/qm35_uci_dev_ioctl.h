/**
 * DOC: UCI char device IOCTLs
 *
 * The UCI char device supports the following IOCTLs.
 *
 * * %QM35_CTRL_RESET (1): Issue a device reset and return device state.
 * * %QM35_CTRL_RESET_EXT (1): Issue a device reset.
 *
 *   This IOCTL allows resetting the chip to bootrom command mode by setting the
 *   parameter to 1.
 * * %QM35_CTRL_GET_STATE (2): Retrieve current state of device.
 *
 *   This IOCTL is deprecated and is here to maintain compatibility with other
 *   UCI char dev drivers. This driver will always return %READY state by default.
 * * %QM35_CTRL_FW_UPLOAD (3): Start FW update process and return device state.
 * * %QM35_CTRL_FW_UPLOAD_EXT (3): Start FW update process and return device
 *   state.
 *
 *   The name of the firmware file to be loaded is passed as a parameter.
 * * %QM35_CTRL_POWER (4): Manual power management of the device.
 *
 *   This IOCTL is deprecated and is here to maintain compatibility with other
 *   UCI char dev driver. This driver will always do power-management itself when
 *   the UCI char is opened or closed. This IOCTL may be used to force power-down
 *   the device while keeping the UCI device opened but it's better to close the
 *   device correctly as it allows to unload the transport driver (which is not
 *   possible when UCI char device is kept opened).
 * * %QM35_CTRL_SET_STATE (5): Change the current device state value.
 *
 *   This IOCTL allows an app to change the current state, but this will be only
 *   until another event comes since the state is reset to ready each time an
 *   event is received.
 * * %QM35_CTRL_GET_TYPE (6): Retrieve current type of message exchanged.
 *
 *   By default, when opened, the type of message received and sent is set to
 *   UCI. This IOCTL allows applications to retrieve the current type.
 * * %QM35_CTRL_SET_TYPE (7): Set type of message exchanged.
 *
 *   This IOCTL allows applications to change the type of messages sent to  or
 *   received from the device, allowing them to manually flash, retrieve logs or
 *   change logs configuration.
 * * %QM35_CTRL_WAIT_EVENT (8): Wait for an event without consuming CPU when
 *   file is open in NON-BLOCKING mode. You may use the poll() API instead.
